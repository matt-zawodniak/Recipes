Notable Features:
- List sortable by name or cuisine
- Recipe list searchable independent of capitalization and keeps sorting method.
- Tapping on a recipe opens a sheet focused on that recipe.
- Recipe sheet includes active link to full recipe and embedded youtube video, if addresses are provided.

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I chose to focus on the RecipeList and RecipeView, as the user would be spending all their time on those two screens. I made sure they both had at least the minimum number of features a user might expect, and included easy to implement features from data provided by the API.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
There are many features I did not include as part of the MVP that might be desired by users. For example, a random button in case the user wants to be adventurous rather than look up a specific cuisine or recipe, or the ability to favorite a recipe and view favorites only. Both of these might increase user retention, but since they weren't part of the original specs and I wasn't sure how useful they would be, in the interest of time they were not included.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
There are two areas I feel the project could be improved significantly. The first is how generic it feels. The project could definitely use some styling with the background, font, and/or colors to make it more visually appealing. The second is the RecipeView itself. While I'm happy with all the content that is on that page, it could definitely be more visually appealing.
