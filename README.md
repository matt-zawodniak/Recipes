# Recipes
 
### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I chose to focus on the RecipeList and RecipeView, as the user would be spending all their time on those two screens. I made sure they both had at least the minimum number of features a user might expect, and included easy to implement features from data provided by the API.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
Total time: approximately 7.5 hours.
- 1.5 hours: Planning UI, Initial UI setup for recipe list, API setup.
- 4 hours: Mock API data for testing, unit tests.
- 1 hour: UI for errors and empty data, make list sortable, adjust single recipe view.
- 1 hour: Make recipe list searchable, add recipe link and embedded video to single recipe view.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
There are many features I did not include as part of the MVP that might be desired by users. For example, a random button in case the user wants to be adventurous rather than look up a specific cuisine or recipe, or the ability to favorite a recipe and view favorites only. Both of these might increase user retention, but since they weren't part of the original specs and I wasn't sure how useful they would be, in the interest of time they were not included.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
There are two areas I feel the project could be improved significantly. The first is how generic it feels. The project could definitely use some styling with the background, font, and/or colors to make it more visually appealing. The second is the RecipeView itself. While I'm happy with all the content that is on that page, it could definitely be more visually appealing.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
This was the first time I tested API calls and file fetching, so the reason it was such a time sink was because I had to learn how to do it during implementation.
